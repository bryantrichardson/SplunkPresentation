# Splunk Presentation

## Description
Within this project, I go through a fake company's Windows and Apache logs to deterime when and where an attack occurred. It is my job to analyze the logs to figure out how to prevent a similar attack from happening in the future. Using Splunk in combination with the log files, I was able to determine baselines and create alerts for specific events to hopefully prevent future attacks.  <br><br>(For transparency, this project was done as apart of my Cybersecurity Bootcamp through UNCC School of Professional Studies)
