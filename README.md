# Splunk Presentation

## Description
Within this project, I go through a fake company's Windows and Apache logs to deterime when and where an attack occurred. It is my job to analyze the logs to figure out how to prevent a similar attack from happening in the future. Using Splunk in combination with the log files, I was able to determine baselines and create alerts for specific events to hopefully prevent future attacks.  (For transparency, this project was done as apart of my Cybersecurity Bootcamp through UNCC School of Professional Studies)
